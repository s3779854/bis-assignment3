  <h1>Project Background</h1>

  <h3>Motivation</h3>
    <p>Video games have been around for decades and become a mature industry. Many of our group members are interested in game development. However, the limitations of our knowledge and technologies prevent us from making a large scale video game. So, we chose to focus on the game-genre of 2D platformer to pay homage to the classic Super Mario Bro. With about 12 weeks development, we decided to complete a 2D platformer game using our own sprite design, level design and sound design.</p>
    <p>In addition, the current situation of COVID-19 outbreak motivated our group to design the related game theme. The name of our game is Coronavirus Counterattack. Hopefully, this game can provide some entertainment to people during the difficult time.</p>

    My interest in game development spans from enjoying to create, enjoying games and enjoying to learn about different aspects of IT. I had no experience with game development, including programming and using programs for game development, however I had some experience with the creative aspect like making art for the game. However, once the project had been finalised, I gained a knowledge on another skillset useful for game development - using unity and basic programming with C# script.<br><br>

    The role I assumed in the project was creating all sprites besides level sprites, the programming of enemy AI and implementing those enemies and making, programming and implementing the health system for the playable character, including the health bar.</p>

    Playing a lot of video games and enjoying them but never actually taking part in creating one is what sparked the curiosity and made me interested in game development. Before this project, I only had very basic programming knowledge. Throughout this project, I was continuously challenged and as a result learned many new invaluable skills or improved existing skills in aspects such as C# coding, sound designing, project planning and management, teamwork and how to use GitHub. <br><br>
    The role I took on for this project was designing the sounds for the game and coding the triggers for the sound based on the conditions of the game, and coding the controls for character movement and abilities such as double jumping and dashing.</p>

    My interest in this topic was from learning new skills about game development to create a game with code. Before this project, I have never expected to use the knowledge I have learnt to code a game project. I just learnt the basic concept of Java and C. Because of my lack of knowledge, I need to make an effort to learn new knowledge from internet tutorials and teammates during this project. And I have learnt a lot in this process, including using Unity to manage a game project, writing C# scripts as game components and collaborating with teammates using efficient tools like Teams and Trello.<br><br>
    My role in this project is responsible for making an inventory system for the game. Basically It is about the interaction between character and items including the collection of the items and the usage of the items.</p>

    My interest in the topic was from creating a game as it’s an aspect of computer programming that I was unfamiliar with and I wanted to gain experience in game development. <br><br>
    Before starting this project I had experience in programming as well as some knowledge of game design. During the development of this I have gained skills in Unity as well as programming skills specific to game development, I have also got to practice a bit of sprite art as I had created some of the 2D assets used in the game. I have also gained more knowledge in working on a programming project with others. My role in the project was for level design which included creating the design of the levels, implementing the levels into the game itself through the use of tools in Unity and creating the art assets for the level.</p>

    I always have a strong interest in playing games and finding out the newest IT technology. Before starting this project, I only have a little knowledge of JAVA and C++. From working through the project I have learned how to code with C# and Unity. The project also makes me more familiar with the game development concept as well as the skills of working in a group. My role in this project is to make the basic movement of the characters including the camera control to follow the character. Also, I implement the combat system as well as the shooting of the character, the damage done by the bullet, the bullet damage and the health of the enemy.</p>

  <h3>Aims and Goals</h3>
    <h4>Aim</h4>
    <p>The aim of this project is using Unity game engine to develop a tiny 2D platformer game similar to Super Mario. Under the current situation of COVID-19 outbreak, our group wants to provide entertainment to people who need to stay at home to help them get through the difficult times. Therefore, making our game’s playability stronger is the key to success. To achieve this aim, we have planned to implement some features in the game as our goals.</p>

  <h3>Scope</h3>
    <p>As a group, we decided on a specific type of game and committed to that specific type of game design. The scope follows the features of a “Metroidvania” platformer, however due to that format having so many features, not all features were considered going into the final prototype. However, we chose essential features to implement. Many features that were not considered into the final prototype are touched on in the extended viable feature section.</p>
