      The scope of the project contracted a bit as we initially had plans to do multiple stages and more varieties of enemies but due to time constraints we weren’t able to complete these. We have basically implemented a near complete “vertical slice” which encapsulates the main mechanics of the game and puts that in an environment where the player can experience what the game will be like with all features included.
    </p> <br>
    <p style="max-width: 50%;text-align: center;align-content: center;margin: 0 auto;">
      I think if we were to try this again we could’ve focused on more features for the first stage to try and make a more “complete” version of the game we had envisioned instead of trying to focus our time on thinking multiple stages would be implemented as that wouldn’t add as much to our project as adding more features and showing something closer to our original vision.
