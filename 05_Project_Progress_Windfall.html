    <h3>Unity Asset Store</h3>

    <p>During the game development, we discovered that the Unity Asset Store was providing various 2D/3D assets and environments for developers to buy and sell. Some artwork can be downloaded from the store. We thought it would be a quicker way to achieve the design aspects of our game. But we already had our own design at that time and were sure to use our own design rather than downloading from the store, so we can not say our estimation was “over generous”.</p>
