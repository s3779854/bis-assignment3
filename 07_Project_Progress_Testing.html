      Testing was mostly done by the person who implemented the feature. Using Unity Collaborate we had to ensure that the features were working as intended on everyone's project, this involved some collaborative testing to clarify issues as not everyone was familiar with every part of the project as we had delegated tasks out.

    <p style="max-width: 50%;text-align: center;align-content: center;margin: 0 auto;">
      If we were to do anything differently we would try to allocate time for more thorough testing as we had a few bugs that slipped through that could have been avoided, if we had dedicated time to testing for bug free implementation we would have been able to have a more polished experience for the player as well as further develop our knowledge of Unity.
