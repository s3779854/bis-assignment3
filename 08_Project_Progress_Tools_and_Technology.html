        <td>Unity is an engine built for streamlining the process of game development by creating features to build games in a prebuilt engine. 
        It has a lot of tools for both 2D and 3D games which users can create games without innate knowledge of programming a game engine 
        or anything related to it such as creating a renderer, etc.</td>
        <td>We have decided to use Unity as it has a lot of in built support for 2D games, compared to something like Unreal Engine which has itâ€™s 
        2D features not getting support for quite some time. Unity is also very well documented making it easy to research how to implement features or 
        how to solve certain problems we might encounter during the development of our game. Using Unity would also give us some experience in developing games 
        using pre-existing engines which would assist us as our group has an interest in developing games.</td>

        <td>Aseprite is an art program specifically created for sprite work and animation. It has features for creating sprite art as well as animating it.</td>
        <td>As we are going with sprite/pixel art this program is a good choice as it has a lot of features specifically for creating sprite art, it has features for 
            animation such as being able to compare sprites easily for reference during animations. It also has good features for colouring and creating sprites themselves 
            such as palette options or tiling sprites.</td>

            music/sound effects and it would be too difficult to learn and is out of the scope of the unit.</td>
