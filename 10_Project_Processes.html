    <h3>What have you learned about group projects? What has worked well in your group? What hasn’t worked well?</h3>

    <p>Our group has worked quite well with communicating and working together, any issues have been communicated well and people have always been there to assist when needed. Our team members have also finished their work in a timely manner and there were no issues where someone wasn’t contributing as everyone has been contributing quite equally to the project. We had also experienced a group member dropping out but we had handled the project quite well in regards to covering any work that was to be done by the previous group member.</p>

    <p>The things that have not worked well with our group were our judgement with timelines. We had not accurately judged the amount of work we could complete so we had to scale back on some aspects, though in saying that we had handled it mostly well in being able to realistically set new goals for our project, though it could definitely have been handled a bit better.</p>

    <h3>What use did you make of your Mentor? What use did you make of your Lecturer in guiding you? </h3>

    <p>Our mentor and lecturer were both very useful in terms of getting feedback about our project as well as giving guidance and some direction when we were previously lacking such as contributing a theme for our game. Receiving weekly feedback from our Mentor was quite helpful as well as we were able to see if we were on track for completing any MVFs and correcting anything where we were going in the wrong direction for our work.</p>

    <h3>What were the group processes for communication? How effective were they?</h3>

    <p>The group processes for communication were mostly done through Microsoft Teams which included both meetings over voice chat and using the text chat. We would plan meetings if there was anything we needed to coordinate together and we had used the text chat for less formal communication just to try and sort things out between individual group members.</p>

    <h3>Have there been any changes since the start of the semester?</h3>

    <p>We didn’t experience any changes since the start of the semester in regards to anything, everything had been mostly consistent.</p>

    <h3>From your experience in this project, what is the most important aspect of organising a project of this nature? Is there anything you would do differently if you were to start again?</h3>

    <p>The most important aspect of organising a project of this nature would be to have a good grasp of the work involved and to set a realistic goal to reach. Knowing how long features can take to implement or how long it may take to see some work done would help you accurately grasp how much work can be completed and what should be focused on and what should be dropped for potential future.</p>

    <p>If we were to do anything differently it would be to try and discuss which features we think were most important and which ones we think we could exclude and focus on those from the beginning rather than spread ourselves too thin which we had experienced as a problem for a bit.</p>

    <h3>What advice would you give to a group about to embark on a similar project?</h3>

    <p>Advice we would give to a group trying to embark on a similar project would be to become familiar with the engine and plan afterwards, this will give you a good idea of what to expect as well as how long things would take to implement. This will give you a more realistic outlook of the project during the planning phase.</p>
